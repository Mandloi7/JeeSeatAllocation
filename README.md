# JEE Seat Allocation <br />

A web platform similar to https://josaa.nic.in (Official counseling platform to allocate seats to JEE candidates)

Students can fill their preferences and lock their choices before the deadline.<br />
The Allocator then runs the Algorithm to allocate the seats to the candidates taking care of all the minute details such as gender, category,etc. <br />
Algorithm is a variant of Gale Shapley Algorithm and it follows the JoSAA business rules.<br/>
